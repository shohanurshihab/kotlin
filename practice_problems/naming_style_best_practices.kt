// In the updated code:

// The function "PEDOMETERstepsTOcalories" has been renamed to "convertStepsToCalories" to follow the camel case naming convention for functions.
// The function parameter "NumberOFStepS" has been renamed to "numberOfSteps" to use lowercase letters and make it more readable.
// The variable "Steps" in the main function has been renamed to "steps" to follow the camel case naming convention for variables.
// The variable "CaloriesBURNEDforEachStep" has been renamed to "caloriesBurnedForEachStep" to use lowercase letters and make it more readable.
// The variable "TotalCALORIESburned" has been renamed to "totalCaloriesBurned" to use lowercase letters and make it more readable.
// These changes adhere to common coding conventions, making the code more readable and maintainable.
